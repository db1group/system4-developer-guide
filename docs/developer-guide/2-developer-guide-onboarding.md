## Preparing your local environment

### GIT

Git is a version control system used for tracking changes and controlling the version of our projects. The newest version of Git can be found in https://git-scm.com/downloads. 

### IntelliJ IDEA

The System4 backend is using **Java 8**, then we recommend using the IntelliJ IDEA. This IDEA is an integrated development environment for developing computer software in Java and other JVM-based languages.

The newest version of IntelliJ IDEA Community can be found in https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download. 

### MySQL

System4 uses the MySQL database. The DBMS for MySQL is the MySQL Workbench. System4 doesn't use the newest version of MySQL, thus you need to download the **version 5.X.X**.

The DBMS for MySQL can be found in  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/. Select the right version as shown below.

The **version 3.x** of Open VPN Connect can be found in https://openvpn.net/client/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/.

## Configure System4 VPN on OpenVPN Connect

You need to request access to the System4 VPN. Ask your manager to email System4 team requesting your access. System4 team will send you your credentials.

In the OpenVPN Connect, you need to add the System4 host (**206.216.146.203**) and your credentials. See the following images as example.
